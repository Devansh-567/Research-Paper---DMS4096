## 📝 Abstract
**DMS 4096** introduces an advanced encryption approach designed to meet the growing demand for high-performance and secure data storage solutions.  

Conventional algorithms like **AES-256** and **RSA-4096** face challenges such as:
- Performance bottlenecks  
- Key management inefficiencies  
- Vulnerabilities to side-channel attacks  

The **DMS 4096 algorithm**, with its innovative architecture, enhances both **security strength** and **execution efficiency**. It surpasses AES-256 and RSA-4096 in encryption speed and data privacy through:
- A novel **key management strategy**  
- An **optimized encryption mechanism**  

This paper provides a comparative analysis using key performance indicators such as:
- Execution time  
- Security robustness  
- Entropy values  

With promising applications in **IoT, cloud computing, and post-quantum cryptography**, DMS 4096 enhances **data confidentiality** and optimizes **system performance** for real-world use cases.
